# Moving-Object-Recognition-and-Tracking

## MATLAB

Detection of moving objects and motion-based tracking is presented in this project. Such components are used in computer vision applications, including activity recognition, traffic monitoring, and automotive safety. The tracking in this project was solely based on motion with the assumption that all objects move in a straight line with constant speed. When the motion of an object significantly deviates from this model, the example may produce tracking errors.
